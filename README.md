2024 NASA SpaceApps Challenge Exeter (UK) Event Submission
# Time Loop Simulator

https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/nasa-space-apps-2024/find-a-team/time-loop-simulator/

Our team comprises individuals from diverse backgrounds, including teaching, computer science, and experience in blue light services. 

Our primary objectives revolve around two key areas: raising awareness of environmental issues within our local communities and promoting the GLOBE Program (Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment). The GLOBE Program enables communities to collect real-world weather data, which in turn informs and equips us to address climate challenges effectively.

To achieve these goals, we’ve developed an interactive educational game centered around the 1952 Lynmouth Flood Disaster. This case study serves as a powerful example of how natural disasters can be mitigated through proactive planning and early intervention measures. Specifically aimed at KS3 and KS4 students, our game encourages collaborative discussions on flood defense options. Students work together, make choices, and vote on various strategies throughout the game. At the end of the exercise, we evaluate the costs associated with the decisions made. It’s an engaging text-based game that fosters critical thinking and awareness.
